<p><b>Qualification Scenarios ODI World Cup Semifinal:</b>The ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 has reached its final week, with India and South Africa having already secured their spots in the semi-finals. While India remain unbeaten, the competition for the other two semi-final berths is fierce. With Bangladesh and England eliminated from contention, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands are still in the running, although their chances are slim. The last week of the group stage promises exciting action for fans and spectators.</p>
<p><b>Qualification Scenarios of New Zealand Team Expected to Reach the Semi-finals:</b></p>
<p><b>New Zealand:</b></p>
<p>- New Zealand has won 4 matches and lost 4, with a net run rate of +0.398.</p>
<p>- Their final group match is against Sri Lanka on November 9th.</p>
<p><b>Path to qualification:</b>New Zealand's path to the semi-finals involves winning their last match and ensuring their net run rate surpasses that of at least two of the other three teams (Pakistan, Australia, and Afghanistan) with either 10 points or the potential to reach 10 points.
If New Zealand lose their final match, they must hope that both Pakistan and Afghanistan lose all their remaining matches, ensuring that their net run rate surpasses both of them.</p>
